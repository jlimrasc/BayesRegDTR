Description: Methods to estimate optimal dynamic treatment regimes using Bayesian
    likelihood-based regression approach as described in  Yu, W., & Bondell, H. D. (2023).
    Uses backward induction and dynamic programming theory for computing
    expected values. Offers options for future parallel computing.
